# Filename: greedy solver.r
#
# Computes a true greedy policy for the PPR problem.
# This policy ignores the R matrix and instead selects the available action (parcel)
# that has the highest individual benefit M[a, t] at each state and time.
#
# INPUTS:
# M      - The Benefit array [J x H]. This is the information the greedy agent uses.
# P      - UNSUSED but included for compatibility.
# R      - UNSUSED but included for compatibility.
# discount - UNSUSED but included for compatibility.
# H      - The planning horizon (number of time steps).
# h      - UNSUSED but included for compatibility.
# J      - The number of sites.
#
# OUTPUTS:
# A list containing:
# policy - An [S x H] matrix where policy[s, t] is the greedy action for state s at time t.
# V      - A placeholder matrix for compatibility.
